Project Proposal: News Website

1. Stack:

Back-end: Flask for creating the web server and handling requests. SQLAlchemy will be used as the ORM to manage the database.

Database: PostgreSQL for production to store user data, bookmarked articles, and any necessary metadata.

APIs: Integration with NewsAPI.org to fetch and update news articles from various sources

2. Focus:

The focus of this project will be on back-end development. The primary goal is to efficiently manage data storage, retrieval, and integration with external APIs. The project will ensure a robust back-end infrastructure to handle user requests, API calls, and database operations seamlessly.

3. Type:

This project will be a web-based application, with the back-end serving as the core component. The front-end will be minimal, possibly using a simple templating engine like Jinja2 to display data for testing and demonstration purposes.

4. Goal:

The goal of the project is to develop a reliable back-end system that provides users with real-time news articles from various sources. It will also allow users to bookmark and categorize articles. The project aims to ensure fast and accurate data processing and provide a scalable solution that can handle increasing user demands and data.

5. Users:

The target users are developers and stakeholders interested in examining the efficiency and capabilities of the back-end system. The project will also serve as a demonstration of back-end technologies and integration skills for potential employers or evaluators.
